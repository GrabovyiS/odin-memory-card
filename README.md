# Odin Memory Card game

## Implementation details

Responsive memory card game using pokeapi. Fetching data with useEffect is done so that it eliminates race conditions. Responsive overlay on victory and defeat screens behaves almost like a position sticky element taken out of normal flow, but with different scrolling speeds for certain conditions.
